## 1. xmlport builder. 
An XMLport is one of the 7 object types in business central. <br>
It works along side Tables (another object type). <br>
Think of tables as the normal SQL table or an excel worksheet.<br>
XMLPorts is an alternative chanel for populating tables. <br>
It is a way that you can use import data from a csv file to Tables.<br>


### How to use it.
1. in the Develper Environment 👨🏽‍💻, open the table that you'd like to create an xml-port for.
2. Copy all fields *(ctrl + A , ctrl + c)* 📄 
3. Open up a csv file in excel and paste the fields📋. Save and close the csv file.
4. open the xmlport_make notebook and populate the **Script parmeters** section.
5. Run all cells. 🏃🏾‍♀️  🏃🏾🏃🏾
6. Import the output file into BC 📥, open, save and compile it. 

NOTE: There may be some issues when importing (IDs and Names may not match) but its all good 😐👍👍.

recommendations:
1. UI.
2. handing for embeded CAL code.
